Iâ€™ve always thought food in Britain would be below par compared to many other cities in the world. With my most recent trip I wanted to prove myself wrong and try some of the most outstanding food it has to offer. This meant saving up the money to afford a 300Â£ meal at Ikoyi, and after leaving completely stuffed and blown away I donâ€™t regret it (maybe I will once I have to check my credit card bills later). There is a ton of info on Ikoyi located at: [https://www.theworlds50best.com/the-list/31-40/ikoyi.html.](https://www.theworlds50best.com/the-list/31-40/ikoyi.html)\

For me, it was important to try a restaurant that is really fancy, but also isnâ€™t just straight up European food. The menu at Ikoyi has a ton of African and Asian components, which you do not see everyday. I recently found out that there are not many Michelin establishments that are ran by BIPOC and the chance to try one of the few meant a lot to me. I understand that lists like Worldâ€™s Best or Michelin can be really stuffy and still arbitrary in their rankings, so I try to go in with an open mind and have my own experience.
