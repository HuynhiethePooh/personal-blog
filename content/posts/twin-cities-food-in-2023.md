In 2023 the Twin Cities food scene saw loads of new restaurants and the closing of old favorites, but it seems like it's going somewhere really special.

Minneapolis and Saint Paul have gone through covid and lockdowns like every other city. I have always thought that one challenge but also opportunity for the twin cities is that they aren't as established fully as more developed food scenes like Chicago, LA or NYC. That's not to say that there isn't an identity to food in Minnesota, but the last few decades have brought so many ethnic groups along with the potential for great diverse food. When a city is going through so much growth and change, setbacks like old favorites going out of business seem massive, but there is so much canvas for a future out of that.

### Pop-ups and small food vendors

Anyone who has spoken to me recently knows that I am pretty much obsessed with [Dahlia](https://www.eatatdahlia.com), a pop-up team formed from ex-travail kitchen members. I've went to various pop ups this year consisting of pastries, sandwiches, burgers, cakes that have traditional flavors but with a spin that you don't normally find at most bakeries. I custom ordered a birthday cake for my sister through Dahlia!

I love the idea of a pop-up because it's usually in collaboration with other small businesses and bringing more attention to both parties creates this sense of community and discovery! It's nice to feel like you are being recognized (for buying so much of their food) and seeing the faces that make your food on a regular basis!

There are so many new products that I've tried like [Bao Bao Buns](https://baobaobuns.com) or [Saturday Dumpling Co](https://www.saturdaydumpling.com) ran by other Foodies that want to share creations with the community. I love that there is an entry point to the food scene without having to have an established restaurant. Even though some products may come and go, more saturation of options for the Twin Cities seems like a great trend.

### More diversity in the food scene

There is something really heartwarming seeing so many people start to embrace Asian food in the last decade. Growing up, none of my friends knew how to pronounce any of the meals that I regularly ate and most wouldn't try foods that seemed "exotic" or "weird". You can see the impact of globalization in most major cities that you visit, but the Twin Cities have some top notch chefs creating amazing menus. The [Minnesota Monthly recently listed their current top 75 restaurants in the state](https://www.minnesotamonthly.com/top-75-restaurants/) and it's very heartwarming to see that so many are Asian or Asian-Influenced. 

There may be some recency bias, but my favorite restaurant that has opened up this year must be Gai Noi. I'm a huge fan of Khaluna so I wasn't very surprised to like another restaurant by Ann Ahmed, but I didn't think it would be one of my new favorites in the cities! The vibes inside the restaurant are perfect for a night out with friends and the prices are very reasonable for what you get. Their cocktails are simple but I love the pea flower and pandan inspired ones. Their Thai Basil wings are also pretty much the same as the ones at Khaluna, but cheaper and still my favorite in the city! My favorite dish there has to be the panang spaghetti, which was al dente both times I have gotten it with the curry flavor really complimenting any dish you pair it with!

### Suburban Expansion - Good or Bad?

I've noticed that since the pandemic there have been many food options opening in the first and second ring of the suburbs. It's hard to narrow down why, but I think it's a mixture of rising taxes/rent in the cities, hesitancy to commute into town to eat and higher demand for food with growing diversity outside the city. It is sad to see the areas that used to be so foot traffic heavy littered with empty store fronts, but it also makes sense on why owners would want to reduce risk and costs for such a hard industry. Rent in the suburbs gives you more room for lower costs, with more parking and customers with less options. It's a conflicting trend to see as I am also glad that more people in the suburbs who may be hesitant to go out of their comfort zones are trying new foods they wouldn't have before.

With Minneapolis looking to raise vacancy fees, that could lead to landlords not charging as ridiculous of rent. That could be a huge change in terms of restaurateurs willing to take the risk if costs are lower. With the expansion of the city there could be a return to densely available options in the city centers co-existing with all the new great options available further out.

There are a lot of suburban options that are chains or may seem bland, but I've actually found quite a few that are just as good as options in the cities (and in some cases better):

* [Mia and More](https://www.google.com/maps/place/M%C3%ADa+and+More+Minnesota/@45.1942004,-93.2320769,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xfac3b10277ad6909?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj5pOD7oMyDAxWml4kEHSUWCJsQ_BJ6BAgPEAA) - A chain that serves my favorite drink of all time: Sugar Cane Juice
* [Mi Sant](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mi-Sant+Kitchen+%26+Bakery/@45.0608595,-93.3232662,12z/data=!4m10!1m2!2m1!1smi+sant!3m6!1s0x52b32bd7df748b4d:0xbb439fcbe1f13b6d!8m2!3d45.0111787!4d-93.179322!15sCgdtaSBzYW50IgOIAQFaCSIHbWkgc2FudJIBFXZpZXRuYW1lc2VfcmVzdGF1cmFudOABAA!16s%2Fg%2F11n0d40q5b?entry=ttu) - This one is cheating since it's been open a while, but this is probably my favorite Banh Mi I've consistently had
* [D Spot](https://www.google.com/maps/place/D-Spot/@44.9610501,-92.966346,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x87f7d7df42e780af:0x417e9a33069b8a7f!8m2!3d44.9610464!4d-92.9614751!16s%2Fg%2F11c3k6jsbz?entry=ttu) - Also has been around for years, but easily has the best wing sauces in the cities
* [Bombay Pizza Kitchen](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bombay+Pizza+Kitchen/@44.848932,-93.4309107,12.1z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x87f61992111e6505:0x3622f1474e3de344!8m2!3d44.863469!4d-93.4874652!16s%2Fg%2F11frddfn_3?entry=ttu) - Seems weird, but their curries on their Pizzas are legit
* [Bussin Birria Tacos](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bussin+Birria+Tacos/@44.8937631,-93.3625127,12.45z/data=!4m6!3m5!1s0x87f62f3c58716f13:0x71b05acea368188f!8m2!3d44.8561895!4d-93.2423763!16s%2Fg%2F11f6d860k_?entry=ttu) - I will defend til my last breath that the best tacos in the state are at the MOA
* [Tous Les Jours](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tous+Les+Jours+Cafe,+Nicollet+Avenue,+Richfield,+MN/@44.975144,-93.0757601,17z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x87f627a4fc57dafb:0xd81a144630a9bac7!8m2!3d44.8830954!4d-93.2775673?entry=ttu) - Very cute Korean cafe chain that has amazing savory and sweet pastries

### Heading into 2024

As a consumer of food I have a more hopeful and optimistic outlook on where the Twin Cities are headed, but maybe that's not such a bad thing. They will always have a special spot in my heart and I can't wait to see how they continue to grow!
